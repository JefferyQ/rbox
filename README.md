# Background
R is a central aspect in the applied sciences to write program and communing codes among statisticians and data scientist, its impact on the development modern statistics is inevitable.  The current researches  more especially for big data  can not be done solely using R and should use different programming languages, hence having a modern Integrated development environment (IDE) is very important. Atom is modern IDE that is developed by GitHub.

# How it works
It uses Hydrogen to run R, also can run codes in the terminal via the editor of Atom.


# Why Rbox?
The first R's gramar for Atom was deployed in [language-r](https://atom.io/packages/language-r) which imported  the grammar from "r.tmbundle" and is no longer maintained, so we decided to work on a tool package suitable for R users who want to use it daily. It is a collection of several packages to facilitate working with R, especially for who want to use R with other programming languages.
